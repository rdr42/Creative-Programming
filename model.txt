Purpose:
  The purspose of this project is to model an autonomous agent that will aid on the creation of generative art.
  
System:
  The system is more than the sum of its parts.
  
Rules:
  Simple rules.
 
Agents:
  Autonomous Agent
  Limited ability to perceive its environment
  Process environment and determines an action
  No global leader, agents are decentralized
 
 
Basing agents on Craig W. Reynolds paper Steering behavior for autonomous characters

Vehicles:
  -Action/Selection: A desired vector.
  -Steering: A force, just a vector.
  -Locomotion: Apply force of steering force to locomotion.
      -Formula: Euler Integration (Location, Velocity, Acceleration)
      -Box2D
